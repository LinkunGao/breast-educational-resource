 * The source copy (web/content/copy.generated.ts) is one long string per
 * modality with no paragraph breaks in it at all, so `splitLede` lifting the
 * first sentence still left everything else as a single 4-6 sentence block --
 * eight unbroken lines in the 400px content column. This is the other half of
 * the same purely typographic measure, and it carries the same absolute
 * constraint: it must never change, reorder or drop a single character.
 *
 * The sentence rule is deliberately identical to `splitLede`'s: a period, `!`
 * or `?`, an optional U+200B (which the source copy really does place next to
 * sentence-ending punctuation, and which `\s` does not match), then
 * whitespace, then a capital letter or an opening `<` tag. Missing a break is
 * always preferred over inventing one mid-sentence.
