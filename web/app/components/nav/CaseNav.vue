/**
 * Previous / next VIEW, at the foot of the content column.
 *
 * A stop is a case's slot, not a case: anatomy -> mammogram -> MRI, then on
 * to the next case's anatomy. The client asked for exactly this -- clicking
 * next should go to the next panel, so the only thing the reader has to do
 * is press next -- and each stop has its own paragraph in this column, so
 * pressing next now walks the whole resource, copy included.
 *
 * The 2D/3D variant is NOT a stop. That was settled earlier, in the same
 * words `PanelTabs` records: the reader switches between the 3D mammogram
 * and the 2D ultrasound rather than passing through one on the way to the
 * other. So a slot holding both is one stop, opening on its 3D default.
 *
 * Order comes from `enabledCases()` -- the same declaration order the
 * sidebar groups and renders, so the two navigations can never disagree.
 *
 * ## On the presentation
 *
 * The overline is the SLOT ("MRI"), in that modality's own ink; below it is
 * the case, as "Density A: Almost entirely fat". The slot leads because it
 * is what changes on two presses out of every three. The group label
 * ("Breast Density") used to be the overline and is gone from this card:
 * the page's own eyebrow and the sidebar both still show it, and it was the
 * one line here that never changed.
 *
 * Both `title` and `heading`, weighted apart rather than run together: the
 * density cases are titled with bare letters, so heading-only produced a
 * link whose entire label was the character "D", while title-only says
 * nothing about what "Density A" looks like. `caption` collapses to one of
 * them for the six cases where the two fields are the same string.
