  <!-- `data-stage-panel` marks the fullscreen target for this panel's own

       to leave it again. Three-up gives each panel its own bar directly
       under its own canvas now, so this replaces the layout's old
       `data-stage-column` as the PREFERRED target -- fullscreening the
       whole column would blow up all three panels when the reader asked
       for one (StageControls falls back to the column for any caller not
       inside a panel). -->

        `role="application"`, NOT `role="img"`.

        This element advertises arrow-key rotation through
        `aria-describedby`, and with `role="img"` that was a lie: NVDA and JAWS
        are in browse mode over an image and consume the arrow keys themselves,
        so the keys never reached `onStageKeydown`. `application` is the
        documented escape hatch for a widget that handles its own keys, and it
        costs nothing here -- the only thing inside is a canvas, so there is no
        readable content for browse mode to have been useful on. The name and
        the key help both still come through, because `aria-label` and
        `aria-describedby` are unaffected by the role.

        The focus ring is drawn with an inset double box-shadow rather than an
        outline, and that is a contrast fix, not a stylistic one. The stage is
        `absolute inset-0` inside a column that scrolls and clips, so an
        outward ring gets cut off -- but the inward `-outline-offset-2` it used
        instead put the brand ring straight onto canvas pixels, where its
        contrast depends on whatever the model happens to be showing and cannot
        be guaranteed at all. The inner shadow pairs the brand ring with a 2px
        surface-coloured ring just outside it, so it always sits against a
        known colour: 4.95:1 on `--color-surface`, comfortably over §11's 3:1
        non-text floor, whatever is rendered underneath. Pinned in
        test/nav-contrast.test.ts.

        Always mounted, never behind a v-if (a bug fixed while wiring Task 8):
        useCopperStage builds its one WebGLRenderer against whatever DOM node
        `host` pointed to at mount time and never rebuilds it. `assetLoadError`
        clears on every subsequent successful `load()`, so a v-if/v-else here
        would unmount-then-remount this element on recovery, leaving the
        existing canvas attached to an orphaned node while a brand new, empty
        host sits in the document -- a permanently blank stage even though the
