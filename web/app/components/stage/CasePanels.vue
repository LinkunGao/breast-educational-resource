      Three-up above a 1000px CONTAINER width, one-up below it.

      A container query, not a viewport breakpoint, and that is the point:
      the threshold is this column's width, so collapsing the sidebar and
      the content panel -- both already offered in the header, for exactly
      this projection case -- can promote a 1440px laptop into three-up. A
      viewport breakpoint could not. 1000px leaves each panel ~333px.

      Hiding is `hidden` (display:none), never `invisible`: a display:none
      element measures 0x0, and that measurement is the whole load gate
      inside CopperStage. Verified in Chromium -- observing a display:none
      element fires immediately at 0x0, and again with real dimensions when
      it is shown.
