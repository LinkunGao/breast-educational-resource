/**
 * Matches the legacy app's only GLB material treatment
 * (frontend/components/model/LeftModel.vue:160-174): the fat-layer mesh
 * becomes a translucent amber (`#a3932a`, 40% opacity) so the
 * fibroglandular tissue underneath reads through it -- the whole point of
 * showing an anatomy model per density case. copper3d's `loadPureGLB` (the
 * only method with a `color` option, and not even the one this renderer's
 * scene class exposes -- see copper-types.ts's `loadGltf` doc) never
 * actually reads that option: dist/bundle.esm.js:83678-83706 applies
 * `enhanceMaterial`'s generic PBR tweaks but never touches `opts.color`.
 * There is no library feature to lean on here, so this reproduces the
 * legacy component's traversal by hand instead of inventing a new
 * appearance (a flat pink tint, as an earlier draft of this task assumed,
 * would not have matched the original app at all).
 *
 * REPLACES the material, as the legacy app does. An earlier version instead
 * mutated the GLB's own material in place -- setting `transparent`,
 * `opacity` and `color` on it -- to avoid importing `three` here. That is
 * not the same thing, and it is what the human meant by the colour being
 * off, and drab:
 *
 *   - `material.color` MULTIPLIES `material.map` in three. The GLB's fat
 *     mesh carries a flesh-toned baseColor texture, so tinting it olive
 *     produced flesh x olive = a muddy khaki. The legacy material has no
 *     `map` at all, so `#a3932a` is the literal colour of a clean 40%
 *     translucent film, and the flesh tones the human remembers come from
 *     the tissue READ THROUGH it.
 *   - The original also keeps its normal/roughness/metalness maps, which
 *     the legacy material does not have (a fresh MeshPhysicalMaterial is
 *     roughness 1, metalness 0, no maps).
 *
 * Importing `three` here means a second copy of it crosses into a copper3d
 * scene. That is safe because the versions are identical: `three@0.185.1` is
 * pinned in package.json and is the same build copper3d inlines (yarn
 * resolves this app's three from copper3d's own dependency), and three's
 * scene graph dispatches on `.isMesh`/`.isMaterial` marker properties rather
 * than `instanceof` precisely so mixed copies interoperate. If copper3d ever
 * bundles a different revision, that pin must move with it.
