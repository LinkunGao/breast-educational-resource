/**
 * Slice scrubbing (design doc §7.5 and §11's `[`/`]` binding).
 *
 * The legacy implementation (frontend/plugins/copper.js:68-129) moved the
 * slice by exactly ±1 spacing per pointermove regardless of how far the
 * pointer had actually travelled, so the feel had nothing to do with the
 * gesture, and it added/removed its own `pointerdown` listener from inside
 * `pointermove` on every raycast miss. Here the drag distance drives the
 * slice DIRECTLY and proportionally -- one pointermove, one repaint, no
 * easing in between -- and the listeners are attached exactly once.
 *
 * An earlier version set a target and let an eased follower chase it. It
 * looked smoother in isolation and felt wrong in the hand: the image visibly
 * lagged the pointer, which is unacceptable for an instrument the reader is
 * using to look for something. The human's words were: why doesn't the
 * slice update in real time as the mouse moves? The follower survives only
 * for the `[`/`]` keys, where a
 * discrete step genuinely does read better as a short glide than a jump.
 *
 * Three things this file deliberately does not do:
 *
 *  · It owns no animation loop. The follower runs on `run`, which is
 *    useCameraChoreography's `animate` (Task 10 controller correction C8):
 *    one interruptible, reduced-motion-aware, lease-owning driver for the
 *    whole app. Injected rather than imported so this file cannot quietly
 *    become a second one.
 *  · It does not announce every value it passes through. `index` changes on
 *    every frame of an eased scrub; `settledIndex` changes only when the
 *    scrub stops, and that is what the screen-reader live region is bound to
 *    (controller correction C11 -- a live region on the per-frame value
 *    queues one utterance per frame and makes the app unusable with a
 *    screen reader on).
 *  · It does not scrub every drag. A drag that does not START on the slice
 *    plane belongs to OrbitControls, exactly as in the legacy app.
