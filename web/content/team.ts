/**
 * The About page's roster, partner organisations and data citations.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * All of it used to be ONE 3310x2437 PNG (`team.png`, 4.9MB) that the legacy
 * About page rendered with a single `<img>`. Names, affiliations, dataset
 * citations and their DOIs were pixels. That meant: unreadable to a screen
 * reader, unsearchable, unselectable, untranslatable, blurred on zoom, the
 * DOI links unclickable, and a typo in anyone's name needing the whole sheet
 * re-exported. `scripts/extract-team-photos.mjs` cuts the sixteen portraits
 * out of that sheet; everything that was TEXT in it lives here as text.
 *
 * ## Provenance, and what still needs checking
 *
 * The names and the first two citations are transcribed from a screenshot of
 * the DEPLOYED legacy site, which is newer than any source that was in this
 * repository -- on the version we had, they existed only inside the bitmap.
 * A human needs to confirm spellings, current affiliations, and whether the
 * roster is still accurate.

   * wildly different proportions -- a compact 201x120 ribbon, an 811x120
   * wordmark, a 587x120 lockup -- so any single CSS rule makes two of them
   * wrong: matched heights leave the ribbon a stamp beside a banner, matched
   * widths make the ribbon tower over the other two. The legacy app solved it
   * the same way and for the same reason (`w-20` / `w-32` / `w-48` in
   * frontend/components/about/Logo.vue); optical balance is a property of the
   * artwork, and the artwork is what lives here.
