/**
 * Design doc §12 item 10: zero `serious` or `critical` axe violations.
 *
 * What axe cannot reach -- keyboard paths through the 3D canvas,
 * screen-reader announcements, reduced motion -- is in
 * `web/test/a11y-checklist.md`, which is the residue after automation.
 *
 * These run as tests rather than as a console tool (controller correction
 * C6) so a regression fails a run. The brief originally reached for
 * `@axe-core/cli`, which drives its own Chrome and races an unmanaged
 * `yarn dev &`; Playwright already owns both a browser and the server
 * lifecycle.
 *
 * ## Scanned AFTER the modality has loaded, never before
 *
 * The stage spends the first several seconds of a case page showing a
 * spinner, and the control bar's buttons are disabled until the renderer
 * exists. Scanning that state would audit a page no reader ever settles on
 * and would miss the enabled controls entirely -- which is where colour
 * contrast and accessible names actually have to hold up.
 *
 * ## Impact levels are reported, not just the failing ones
 *
 * `moderate`/`minor` findings are printed for the record but do not fail:
 * §12 sets the bar at serious/critical, and silently swallowing the rest
 * would make the number in the report unverifiable.
 */

/**
 * Waits until the stage has finished loading AND the renderer exists.
 *
 * The control bar's Reset button is disabled until `actions` is published,
 * which happens only after the async renderer build completes -- so waiting
 * on it is the strongest available proof that the scan below is auditing a
 * settled page rather than a spinner. It also puts the bar's ENABLED colours
 * under the contrast rules, which is the state that has to hold up and the
 * one a scan run too early would never see.
