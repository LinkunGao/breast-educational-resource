/**
 * The §12 criteria that can only be measured against what actually ships.
 *
 * The rest of `test-browser/` runs against `yarn dev`, which is right for
 * behaviour and wrong for bytes: Vite serves every dependency unbundled, so
 * `/the-breast` costs 24MB there, 15MB of it copper3d.js and three.module.js
 * in source form. Measuring §12 item 7's 3MB budget against that number
 * would be measuring the dev server, not the app.
 *
 * So this serves `.output/public` -- the real `nuxi generate` artefact, the
 * exact bytes the GitHub Pages workflow publishes -- over a static server
 * modelled on GitHub Pages, measured against the real host on 2026-07-30:
 *
 *   · `Cache-Control: max-age=600` plus an ETag, so caching behaves as it
 *     will in production (`curl -I https://pages.github.com/favicon.ico`).
 *   · gzip for text, which is the difference between passing and failing a
 *     transfer budget: Pages serves `/js/jquery.js` as 33,081 bytes against
 *     93,107 on disk. Without this the §12 item 7 measurement below is
 *     inflated ~2.8x on the JS, which is most of that page's weight.
 *
 * Binary assets (`.wasm`, `.glb`, `.nrrd`, images) are served uncompressed
 * here. Pages may well compress some of them; not modelling that keeps the
 * measured number an UPPER bound, which is the safe side for a budget.
 *
 * SKIPPED when there is no build, rather than failing: `yarn test:browser`
 * has to stay runnable without a 90-second `yarn generate` in front of it.
 * Run `yarn generate` first to include these.
 *
 * Also carries the PWA checks (client feedback item 1). They started in
 * their own `test-browser/pwa.spec.ts` against `yarn dev`, which turned out
 * to prove nothing: `nuxi dev` never emits a real service worker or manifest
 * unless `devOptions` forces one, and a dev-only worker is not the artefact
 * that ships. A PWA is a production artefact, so it belongs in the file that
 * already tests production artefacts.
