 * Client feedback: the MRIs are too dark for a student to read.
 *
 * copper3d windows a volume on its own min/max, and on these MRIs the max is
 * a handful of bright outliers, so the tissue sits in the bottom of the
 * range. `sliceExposure.ts` lifts the mid-tones with a gamma curve.
 *
 * That the curve cannot clip -- the other half of the client's feedback, and
 * what sank two earlier attempts -- is proved exactly in
 * `test/sliceExposure.test.ts`. What is left for a browser is the half no
 * unit test can reach: that the lift survives copper3d's repaint and reaches
 * the screen at all.
