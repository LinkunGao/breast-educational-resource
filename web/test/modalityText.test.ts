/**
 * The two tests above are given by the task brief, but neither is capable of
 * catching a real bug found while implementing this function: the source
 * copy in copy.generated.ts places a U+200B zero-width space directly after
 * the period ending the "Breast density has four grades..." sentence in the
 * density A/B/C anatomy texts (density_4's phrasing happens to put the
 * ZWSP *before* the period instead, so it alone doesn't expose the bug).
 * Since \s does not match U+200B, a naive `[.!?]\s+` fails to split at that
 * point and instead swallows one or two more sentences into the lede before
 * finding the next break -- silently defeating the whole point of lifting
 * *only* the first sentence into the lede style. The "never mutates
 * characters" round-trip above still passes either way (no character is
 * lost, just misplaced between lede/rest), so it can't tell a correct split
 * from this bug. These tests use the real, untruncated strings from
 * copy.generated.ts and assert the actual split point, which the truncated
 * synthetic samples above cannot do.
