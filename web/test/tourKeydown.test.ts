/**
 * Fix round 2, finding 1: `CopperStage`'s own arrow-key camera controls call
 * `preventDefault()` (not `stopPropagation()`), so `TourLayer`'s
 * window-level keydown listener still sees the event bubble past it. Without
 * yielding to `defaultPrevented`, a reader who focuses the 3D stage and
 * presses an arrow key both orbits the camera AND silently steps the tour --
 * exactly the keys the `rotate` step's own copy tells them to press.
 *
 * `TourLayer` is `.client` and pulls in `useTourDirector`/`useRoute`, which
 * `test/setup.ts` deliberately does not stub, so mounting it here is
 * impractical. `decideTourKeydown` is the entire decision rule `onKeydown`
 * delegates to (the dispatch that follows -- `store.next()` / `.back()` /
 * `exitTour()` -- is a direct, untestable-in-isolation call per action), so
 * testing it in isolation covers exactly the logic this bug lived in: an
 * arrow key that resolves to `null` here is one `onKeydown` never acts on,
 * i.e. one that cannot change `store.stepIndex`.
