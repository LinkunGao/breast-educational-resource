 * Client feedback: "There are some minor consistency aspects". CaseHeader's
 * above-the-title eyebrow, CaseSidebar's nav-group heading, and CaseNav's
 * prev/next overline used to type this label out three separate times --
 * 'Benign Condition' (singular) in CaseHeader disagreed with 'Benign
 * Conditions' (plural) in the other two. Both remaining places now read the
 * one CASE_GROUP_LABEL map from content/cases.ts; this test fails if either
 * goes back to a hand-typed literal that drifts from it.
 *
 * CaseNav is the third place and no longer shows the group at all: its
 * overline became the SLOT, so that pressing next -- which now steps
 * anatomy -> mammogram -> MRI -> next case -- says which view it is stepping
 * to. Its own drift guard lives in CaseNav.test.ts.
