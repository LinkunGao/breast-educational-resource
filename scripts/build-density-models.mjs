/**
 * Rebuilds all four density anatomy models from density-3's source.
 *
 * The four `density*.glb` models differ in ONE thing: how many mammary lobes
 * the breast contains. Everything else -- fat, areola, nipple, ducts,
 * sinuses, suspensory ligaments -- is identical across all four, and
 * `density75.glb` (density-3) is the model the author actually built. The
 * others were meant to be it with lobes removed or added:
 *
 *     density-1  -50%   density-2  -25%   density-3  baseline   density-4  +100%
 *
 * They had drifted badly from that. Measured on the shipped assets, counting
 * connected lobe islands: density-1 had 4 of 19 (-79%), density-2 had 7
 * (-63%), and density-4 was not thinned or thickened by lobe at all -- it
 * carried THREE whole copies of the lobes mesh at ~1cm offsets, 227,364
 * triangles for what should be roughly half again the baseline.
 *
 * And the source itself carries four fragments that no duct reaches --
 * lobes whose duct was deleted in Blender, left floating unattached inside
 * the fat layer. Those are dropped from every model including density-3,
 * which is why density-3 is rebuilt here too despite its lobe count being
 * unchanged. See ORPHAN_DISTANCE. The real baseline is 15 lobes, not 19.
 *
 * ## Method
 *
 * Lobes are removed and added as WHOLE LOBES, never as loose triangles. A
 * lobe is a connected component of the `VH_F_mammary_lobes_L` primitive,
 * found by union-find over the index buffer after welding vertices by
 * position -- the mesh is exported unwelded, so without the weld every quad
 * looks like its own island (9,325 of them, which is what a first pass
 * reported).
 *
 * Which lobes go is decided deterministically and spatially: islands are
 * ordered by centroid height and picked with an even stride, so thinning
 * empties the breast uniformly instead of hollowing out one end of it.
 * Re-running this script always produces the same models.
 *
 * For density-4, the extra lobes are copies of existing ones nudged toward
 * the lobe cloud's own centroid, so they stay inside the fat layer.
 *
 * ## Running it
 *
 *     node scripts/build-density-models.mjs [--dry-run]
 *
 * Reads the uncompressed original under `assets-src/modelView/` and writes
 * Draco-compressed output to `web/public/modelView/`, the same arrangement
 * `optimize-assets.mjs` produces. The source is never written.

 * triangles, 11,358 of 34,755 in total. The four debris shards hide none,
 * which is one more piece of evidence that they are not lobes.
