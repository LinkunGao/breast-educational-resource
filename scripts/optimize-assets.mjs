/**
 * Asset compression pipeline (design doc §9.1).
 *
 *   assets-src/modelView/**  ->  web/public/modelView/**
 *
 * · *.nrrd  re-encoded raw -> gzip (three's NRRDLoader reads it natively)
 * · *.glb   Draco geometry compression (@gltf-transform/cli)
 * · *.json  copied as-is (view presets, only tens of bytes)
 * · m2d.nrrd, and u2d.nrrd outside benign-cyst, are skipped as placeholder
 *   copies (design doc §3.1)
 *
 * Idempotent, so it is safe to re-run. Each run builds a full copy of the
 * output into a disposable staging directory, marks it complete by renaming
 * it into a second fixed directory only once every file has succeeded, and
 * only then replaces the real output directory (see the comments around the
 * staging/stagingComplete constants and the final swap below) — so a
 * deleted source file, or output from a run predating a placeholder-filter
 * change, can never linger and ship; a run that throws, is Ctrl-C'd, or is
 * killed outright can't leave web/public/modelView half-populated either,
 * and can't fool the next run into promoting a half-built tree. An NRRD
 * already declaring encoding: gzip or gz is not recompressed (see gzipNrrd
 * in nrrd-gzip.mjs) — repeated successful runs produce identical output.
 *
 * If a compressed NRRD ever fails to load in copper3d, add its path
 * (relative to assets-src/modelView, forward slashes) to the SKIP_GZIP array
 * below and the pipeline will copy the uncompressed original instead.
